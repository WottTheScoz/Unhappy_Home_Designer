Instructions for the Mural Scene scripts.


GameObjects you will need:

- 2D Sprite
*This will be the mural itself.
*Make sure it has a Box Collider 2D and Rigidbody 2D component attached to it.

- Canvas
- TextMeshProUGUI (child of Canvas)
- 2 Buttons (child of Canvas)
*The text will display the timer.
*One button will be the mute button, the other will be the skip button.

- Empty GameObject
*Make sure to attach an Audio Source component to this object, then attach your audio clip to the component.


Script 1: ImageDragging.cs

Attach this script to your mural GameObject.

 Bound Offsetter X - Accounts for any offsets on the x-axis. Naturally set to 1.
 Bound Offsetter Y - Accounts for any offsets on the y-axis. Naturally set to 1.

Note: What these values do is adjust where the boundaries of the mural image are, preventing the player from accidently dragging it off-screen. They are multipliers, so decrease them (to a decimal between 1 and 0) to decrease the size of the boundaries if needed.

Explanation: This script allows the player to drag the mural across the screen. It has been created under the assumption that the mural image will be bigger than the screen.


Script 2: MuralTimer.cs

Attach this script to either your TextMeshProUGUI object or an empty GameObject (your choice).

 Text Object - Displays the timer. Attach your TextMeshProUGUI object to this.
 Target Time - How long the timer lasts. Naturally set to 60 seconds. 
 New Scene Name - The name of the scene you want to transition to. Make sure it is spelled correctly.

Explanation: This script simply holds the timer and displays it. When the timer runs out, the game will transition to the scene of your choice.


Script 3: MuralManager.cs


Part I: The Script Itself

Attach this script to your empty GameObject with an Audio Source component.

 New Scene Name - Same as the one from MuralTimer.cs.
 Audio - The audio clip that you want to mute.


Part II: The Buttons

Go to your Mute button and add an On Click() to it. Attach the object that holds MuralManager.cs to the On Click(), then look for MuralManager > Mute.

Repeat the previous steps for your Skip button, but look for MuralManager > Skip.

Explanation: This script handles all miscellaneous functionality for the Mural Scene. At the moment, it allows the player to mute the game's audio and skip the Mural Scene using buttons.
